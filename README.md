# Friendo Bot - Hello Friendo's Discord Bot

A bot that was created to help friendos learn to code.

# The Idea

With so many of our members looking to learn Python, I figured it'd be a great project for us to build a Discord bot together as a community! We will work together to make project decisions, plan, implement, and review ideas. There will be a scheduled "*class*" once a week for 60-90 minutes while allowing people to work on their own during the week.

# Setup

## Requirements

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* A GitHub account
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    * [Live Share Extension for *class*](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)
* Python 3.10 (Installable through the Microsoft Store on Windows)

## Creating the virtual environment

A virtual environment copies the installed Python system environment, but isolates the packages a project requires into a local installion. This keeps the system install clean by installing packages locally instead of globally to the system.

### Creating the virtual environment

`> python3 -m venv .bot-env`


### Activate the virtual environment

**Windows:**

`> .bot-env\Scripts\activate.bat`

**OSX / Linux:**

`> source .bot-env/Scripts/activate`

## Installing the python libraries

`> pip install -r requirements.txt`
