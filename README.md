# Friendo Bot - Hello Friendo's Discord Bot

A bot that was created to help friendos learn to code.

# The Idea

With so many of our members looking to learn Python, I thought it would be a great idea for us to build a Discord bot together as a community! 

We will build the bot's core framework together and members will create their own custom commands.

There will be a scheduled "*class*" once a week for 60-90 minutes but anyone can work on their own throughout the week on the project.

# Project Setup

## Requirements

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* A GitHub account
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    * [Live Share Extension for *class*](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)
* Python 3.10 (Installable through the Microsoft Store on Windows)

## Creating the virtual environment

A virtual environment copies the installed Python system environment, but isolates the packages a project requires into a local installion. This keeps the system install clean by installing packages locally instead of globally to the system.

### **Creating the virtual environment**

```
python3 -m venv .bot-env
```

### **Activate the virtual environment**

**Windows:**

```
.bot-env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

**OSX / Linux:**

```
source .bot-env/Scripts/activate
```

## Installing the required libraries

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
