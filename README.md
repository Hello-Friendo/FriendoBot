# Friendo Bot - Hello Friendo's Discord Bot

A bot that was created to help people learn to code. Click [**here**](https://discord.gg/3DTtWMZHU4) to join our Discord server!

# The Idea

With so many of our community's members looking to learn Python, I thought it would be a great idea for us to build a Discord bot together, as a community.

We will build the bot's core framework together and members will create their own custom commands.

There will be a scheduled "*class*" once a week for 60-90 minutes but anyone can work on their own throughout the week on the project.
